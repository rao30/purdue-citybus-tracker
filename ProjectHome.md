## Project Summary ##
Purdue CityBus Tracker is an Android application that automates searching of bus schedules using MyRideWEB on Gocitybus.com. The app uses the word Purdue to signify the geographical location of the likely users but it is in no way restricted to Purdue students and staff. All CityBus users in Lafayette/West Lafayette are welcome to use it.

Attribution - Purdue CityBus Tracker depends on MyRideWEB for gathering CityBus schedule data. Additionally it uses [TagSoup 1.2.1](http://ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/) and Android Color Picker aka [AmbilWarna](http://code.google.com/p/android-color-picker/) libraries licensed under Apache Software License 2.0

The source code was built against Android SDK API level 10 on Eclipse IDE (Indigo) with ADT plugin.


### Note ###
**Using the user-defined shortcut buttons on the app is equivalent to**

**1. Pulling up http://www.gocitybus.com/myrideweb.html on your Android phone browser.**

**2. Typing a bus stop name or Quick Code.**

**3. Hitting "Go" button and then clicking on the 1st link on the returned page to view departure schedules.**


**Purdue CityBus Tracker simply automates the above tasks for you saving you multiple clicks and valuable time.**

**_If the app doesn't work as intended, then please verify first that the MyRideWEB service is indeed working by manually visiting the MyRideWEB page._**
